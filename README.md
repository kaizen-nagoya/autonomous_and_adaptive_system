To tackle this problem, scenario-based testing for automated driving defines categories of different scenarios that should be covered. Although this kind of coverage is a necessary c… ▽ More

Context-Aware Misbehavior Detection Scheme for Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks using Sequential Analysis of the Temporal and Spatial Correlation of the Cooperative Awareness Messages
Authors: Fuad A. Ghaleb
Abstract: Vehicular ad hoc Networks (VANETs) are emerged mainly to improve road safety, traffic efficiency, and passenger comfort. The performance of most VANET applications relies on the availability of accurate and recent mobility-information, shared by neighboring vehicles. However, sharing false mobility information can disr… ▽ More
